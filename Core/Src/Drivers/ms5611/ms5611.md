This is the barometric pressure sensor

There are five basic commands on this sensor:
    1. Reset
    2. Read PROM (128  bit of calibration words)
    3. D1 Conversion
    4. D2 Conversion
    5. Read ADC result (24 bit pressure / temp)

Specs:
    - High res module, 10cm
    - Fast conversion down to 1ms
    - Uses 1 microAmp
    - Supply Voltage -> 1.8-3.6 V
    - Integrated digital pressure sensor (24bit ADC)
    - Operates between 10 to 1200 mbar, -40 to 85 C
    - SPI interface up to 20MHz

About:
    - piezo-resistive sensor and has an I2C sensor interface 
    - convert uncompensated analogue output value from sensor to 24 bit digital value and temp of sensor

Calibration:
    - Every module has been has been calibrated at two temp and two pressures, as a result 6 coefficients are necessary to compensate for process variations are calculated and stored in the 128-bit PROM of each module
    - These bits are partitioned into 6 coefficients and must be read by the microcontroller software adn used in the program to convert D1 and D2 into compensated pressure values
    
Serial Interface:
    - Pulling the PS pin (Protocol Select) to low selects the SPI protocol, pulling PS to   high activates the I2C bus protocol 

SPI Mode
    - The external microcontroller clocks in the data through the input SCLK and SDI pins
    - The SPI mode module can accept both mode 0 and mode 3 for clock polarity and phase
    - Sensor responds on the output SDO 
    - CSB (Chip Select) is used to enable/disable interface 
    - CSB pin can be pulled high after cmd is sent or after cmd execution
    - High Res ADCs are most sensitive to digital noise during conversion, so we will place it onto it's own SPI bus as the Barometer's ADC conversion isn't disturbed by other SPI traffic

Pressure and Temperature Calculations:
    - Refer to pg 8

SPI Interface:
    - Refer to pg 10
    - Size of each cmd is 1 byte (8 bits)
    - After the ADC reads commands, the device will return 24-bit result
    - After the PROM is read, the PROM will return a 16-bit result
    - The PROM address is embedded inside the PROM read command using the a2 a1 and a0 bits

    -Reset Sequence:
        - Reset sequence will be sent once after the pwoer-on to make sure that the calibration PROM gets loaded into the internal register
        - Can also be used to reset the device ROM from an unknown condition
    
    - Commands:
        - Register map is found in pg 10

    - Conversion Sequence:
        - The conversion command is used to initiate uncompensated pressure, D1
        - The chip select can be disabled during this time to communicate with othher devices
        - After the converion, using ADC read command the result is clocked out with MSB first
        - If conversion is not executed before the ADC read command or the ADC read command is repeated, it will give 0 as the output result
        - If ADC read command is sent during conversion the result will be 0, the conversion will not stop and the final result will be 0.
        - Conversion sequence sent during the already started conversion process will yield incorrect result as well
        - So we must first start conversion and wait for it to finish first

    - PROM Read Sequence:
        - The PROM read command will be executed once after reset by the user to read the content of the calinration PROM and to calculate the calibration coefficients.
        - There are in total 8 addresses resulting in a total memory of 128 bit
        - Address 0 contains factory data and setup
        - Addressess 1-6 calibration calibration coefficients
        - Address 7 contains the serial code and CRC
        - The command sequence is 8 bits long with a 16 bit result which is clocked with MSB first
